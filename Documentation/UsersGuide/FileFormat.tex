\section{File Formats}

RGG uses its on xml based file format, \ui{RXF}.  It allows to maintain states not stored in Meshkit's \ui{INP} file format.  However, RGG can import \ui{INP} files through by \ui{File} $\rightarrow$ \ui{Import} $\rightarrow$ \ui{INP File}.  RGG can also export \ui{INP} files by \ui{File} $\rightarrow$ \ui{Export} $\rightarrow$ \ui{Inp Files}.  At the time of mesh generation, the user will be asked for a directory if the \ui{INP} files have not been exported yet.
