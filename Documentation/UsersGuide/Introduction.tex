Welcome to the Reactor Geometry Generator User's Guide.  Reactor Geometry Generator (RGG) is a program designed to aid you in modeling and meshing hexagonal and rectilinear reactor cores.  RGG uses Qt and VTK to produce an intuitive user interface.  By integrating a 3D view of the reactor with the meshing tools and combining them into one user interface, RGG streamlines the task of preparing a simulation mesh and enables real-time feedback that reduces accidental mistakes that waste hours of meshing.  RGG also interfaces with MeshKit tools to consolidate the meshing process, meaning that going from model to mesh is as easy as a button click.

This guide is designed to acquaint you with RGG's interface and to give you the knowledge and skills to pilot RGG successfully.  This book is organized in a concept/example manner, meaning that we cover concepts and the way that RGG thinks before we use those same ideas in an example.  Towards the end, we present a reference section that fully explains both the function of particular menus, buttons, and panes and what menu, button, or pane you must use to accomplish your objective.
